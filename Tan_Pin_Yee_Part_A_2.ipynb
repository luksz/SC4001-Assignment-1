Find the optimal batch size for mini-batch gradient descent by training the neural network and evaluating the performances for different batch sizes. Note: Use 5-fold cross-validation on the training partition to perform hyperparameter selection. You will have to reconsider the scaling of the dataset during the 5-fold cross validation."
